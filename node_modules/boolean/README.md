# boolean

boolean converts lots of things to boolean.

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install boolean
```

## Quick start

First you need to add a reference to boolean in your application.

```javascript
const boolean = require('boolean');
```

To verify a value for its boolean value, call the `boolean` function and provide the value in question as parameter.

```javascript
console.log(boolean('true')); // => true
```

The `boolean` function considers the following values to be equivalent to `true`:

- `true` (boolean)
- `'true'` (string)
- `'TRUE'` (string)
- `'t'` (string)
- `'T'` (string)
- `'yes'` (string)
- `'YES'` (string)
- `'y'` (string)
- `'Y'` (string)
- `'1'` (string)
- `1` (number)

*Please note that if you provide a string, it will be trimmed.*

All other values, including `undefined` and `null` are considered to be `false`.
